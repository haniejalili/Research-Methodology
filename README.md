# Predicting the level of accuracy of people in different decision-making situations with the approach of statistics and machine learning
## Abstract
<br> Psychologists and researchers in the field of cognitive science use several cognitive science models to investigate the functioning of the human brain in different decision-making situations.
<br> But our approach in this article is to use statistical models to predict the level of accuracy of people and their decision time to choose one way from among different ways.
<br> The purpose of this project is to identify the factors affecting the speed and accuracy of people in decision-making, so that after analyzing and examining these factors, we can control them and improve the accuracy of people.
<br> To collect the data for this article, we asked different people two-choice questions and asked them to choose the answer that they think is correct. Then we recorded the collected observations.
<br> To model the data, we used logistic regression and gamma regression statistical models and used machine learning approach to analyze them.
<br> The findings show that the mentioned models were well fitted on the data and have high accuracy for predicting people's accuracy in answering and their answering speed.
Therefore, the results of the model can be used to improve people's accuracy in critical decision-making situations and psychological issues.
